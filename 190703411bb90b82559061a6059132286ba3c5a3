What is the use case for that change?

I can see that this is related to symfony/recipes#435

Yes, I have my Symfony Console that is broken.
And for the corrected we can either add the Crawler as a service in the Symfony project or apply this fix which I think will cover more cases (excluding Symfony)

Error :
```
Too few arguments to function SensioLabs\Security\SecurityChecker::__construct(), 0 passed in /Users/mhe/www/perso/my-api/var/cache/dev/ContainerYAbmEjX/getSecurityCheckerCommandService.php on line 13 and exactly 1 expected
```

IMO this change does look reasonable. There is just one `Crawler` right now which isn't even configurable. So manual injection would basically be the same. Also it is inline with how the current code for 4.1 looks like.

As a side note, you should use the 4.1 branch. The master branch is not released yet.
