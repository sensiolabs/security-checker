I am not sure if adding or ext-ctype may help prevent conflits in some installation cases, where other packages may require ext-ctypes only and conflict with the polyfill.

The polyfill is probably not loading when the extension is present and I see that symfony/skeleton and symfony/website-skeleton are replacing the polyfill so conflicts seems to be avoided.

Looks like if adding the "or" would make it more readable for slow humans like me.
