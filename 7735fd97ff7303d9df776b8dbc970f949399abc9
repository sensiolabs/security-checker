That's probably intentional isn't it. They're meant to be immutable arn't they?

Indeed, that's intentional, you should use set them on a crawler and pass it to the security checker instead. That's why I bumped the version of the package to a new major one by the way.

I've just read your related issue. I'm going to have a look at it now.

Ok, that's not that easy to fix. I think a better fix would be to add a `getCrawler` on the security checker and change the command accordingly. Can you try that?
