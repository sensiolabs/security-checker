SensioLabs Security Checker
===========================

The SensioLabs Security Checker is a command line tool that checks if your
application uses dependencies with known security vulnerabilities. It uses the
[Security Check Web service][1] and the [Security Advisories Database][2].

**TIP**: As an alternative, you can use the [Symfony CLI][3] tool that has the
following advantages: it does not depend on PHP, all checks are done locally (no
calls to the security.symfony.com API):

    $ symfony security:check

*Note: Previous versions of security-checker used: `security.sensiolabs.org`. That domain is no longer available for use and has been replaced by `security.symfony.com`. Please upgrade to version 5 of this library to fix errors with the old domain.
See: https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker/issues/149*

Usage
-----

Download the [security-checker.phar][4] file:

    $ php security-checker.phar security:check /path/to/composer.lock

Use the code from the repository directly:

    $ composer install
    $ php security-checker security:check /path/to/composer.lock

Integration
-----------

The checker uses the Symfony Console component; so, you can easily integrate
the checker into your own project:

 * by using the `SecurityCheckerCommand` class into your Symfony Console
   application;

 * by using the `SecurityChecker` class directly into your own code:

        use SensioLabs\Security\SecurityChecker;

        $checker = new SecurityChecker();
        $result = $checker->check('/path/to/composer.lock', 'json');
        $alerts = json_decode((string) $result, true);
